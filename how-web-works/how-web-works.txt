/////////PART ONE : SOLIDIFY TERMINOLOGY

HTTP : Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a protocol where clients request data from, or send data to a server.

URL : a Uniform Resource Locator is the address of a unique resource on the Web.

DNS : a Domain Name System translates human-friendly domain names to a numeric IP address.

Query String : the part of a URL that assigns values to keys.

HTTP Verbs
GET: gets some data from a server. Requests without side effects, for example entering a URL in a browser or searching something on google.
POST: send some data to a server. Requests with side effects: for example submitting a form that sends an email or charges a credit card.

HTTP request : when a client makes a request to a server that follows the HTTP protocol

HTTP response : when a server responds to a client using HTTP protocol by providing the client with the requested resource.

HTTP Header: allows the client and server to share additional information with each HTTP request or response

Request Headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Referer
Response Headers: Date, Content-Type, Last-Modified, Server, Set-Cookie

What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?

1.The browser uses DNS to translate the URL into an IP address
2. The browser sends request to IP address with headers that include additional information about the browser, previously existing cookies, and other stuff
3. Server sends a response usualy consisting of HTML along with a status code response. (200: 'successful', 404: 'not found')
4. The browser creates DOM from the HTML, and locates all other required resources for the page to load properly like images, css, and javascript.
5. The browser makes individual HTTP requests for those resources and the server responds with each resource.
