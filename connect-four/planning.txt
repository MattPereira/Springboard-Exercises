what HTML would be useful for the game board itself?
>>> divs or table

how could you represent a played-piece in the HTML board?
>>> add css to an empty td that has only a border

in the JavaScript, what would be a good structure for the in-memory game board?
>>> array so that you can keep track of order

what might the flow of the game be?
>>> player one chooses row to drop token, then player 2 and loop that until 4 in a row, or until board fills which would be a tie.


Then, write down some functions names/descriptions that would be useful for this game.
