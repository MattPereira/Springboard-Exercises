I am currently working as an IT specialist for an elementary-middle school while progressing through a software engineering bootcamp. Iâ€™m looking forward to incorporating analytical thinking and problem solving skills from my economics degree into programming. I am naturally inquisitive, and love collaborating as part of a team. Recently, I had the opportunity to build a new website for my current employer. The new site is more visually appealing and much easier to navigate. It felt amazing to build something useful and deploy it into the real world. I am seeking future employment at a tech startup that allows me to jump around on the stack and constantly be learning new technologies.
